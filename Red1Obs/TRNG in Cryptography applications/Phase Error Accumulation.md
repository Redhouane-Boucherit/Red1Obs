TRNGs in this category exploit the timing uncertainty, or jitter, that accumulates in
periodic signals generated by electronic oscillators. Jitter arises from the summation of
countless microscopic noise events (e.g., thermal noise) within the circuit’s components,
causing the rising and falling edges of the clock signal to deviate randomly from their
ideal positions. By sampling the state of one fast oscillator with a second, slower or
asynchronous oscillator, this time-domain uncertainty can be converted into a random
sequence of bits. This principle is particularly well-suited for implementation in digital
logic, as it does not require specialized analog components. The most common implementation
of an oscillator-based TRNG uses a simple ring oscillator (RO), which consists
of an odd number of inverters connected in a loop. The accumulated jitter from each
inverter makes the oscillator’s phase unpredictable over time.
